                <p class="blog-text">
                    Welcome everyone! I plan to use this blog post to introduce myself, and the idea behind this blog.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                   First off, I am Danin, and online I go by either danin, or danin317. I am a student at the University of Mathematics and Natural 
                   Sciences in Sarajevo, majoring in Computer Science. At the time of writing this, I am at my first semester out of six.  
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                   I had more plans in mind for this site, I didn't want to make it a basic static portfolio. (Well, the design of this site being baisc 
                   is up for debate). Either way, I wanted to have an active blog that I would use to share my experiences. To be more specific, at the time 
                   of writing this, I am an extremely inexperienced programmer. I currently know the mere basics of Python and JavaScript. And since I am in a 
                   position where I made a website at a time where I am very new to a field, I thought to add a blog page for me to share my journey. I have plans 
                   for a lot of projects, ideas, and other stuff that I wanna share here. 
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    To be more specific, the next couple of paragraphs will go into detail about what I want to achieve with this blog post: 
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    As I have stated before about my programming situation, I want to talk about the projects I make. I have a very big interest in web 
                    development, to be more specific, back-end development (and everything that goes with it), and game development. But, to be honest, 
                    I won't be shy to try out other stuff as well. Specifically, I am quite interested in machine learning, automatization (writing scripts), and 
                    systems programming. So, my plan was to make blog posts about just that. I take a project, make it, and share the details on this blog post. 
                    I assume the bigger the project is, the more blog posts it'll contain, but I don't mind that at all, honestly. Right now though, since the 
                    projects I'm making are very simple (For example, I am making a todo list CLI program. Although to be fair I am trying to add more features 
                    other than "add task" and "remove task")
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    Besides projects, I want to talk about the theory that I'm interested in. This is also ties in with mathematics. Let's say, for example, I research
                    about a topic I'm interested in, and I just talk about it, along with my findings. Right now since we're going over Calculus, it'll probably stay that way 
                    until we get more advanced programming subjects. 
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    Other than that, my hobbies include writing and content creation. Unfortunately, due to university, I am not in a position to do all of my hobbies 
                    every single day, but I want to try to do them at least once per week. I always loved writing, but I haven't published any sort of book, and I want to 
                    make it a goal to have at least one story. I do have a project related to writing, but I'll talk about it more in detail once I actually start work on it. 
                    As for content creation, I used to have a channel, 3.5k subs at the time of writing this, where I 100% retro games. Although I have abandoned this channel, 
                    due to a lot of personal reasons that I don't want to get into (lack of interest, and a rather toxic community to be a tad bit specific), but my drive to create 
                    hasn't gone away. I will probably go back to the 100% idea, but on a way less bigger scale than it was on my last channel, or make a programming channel, with content 
                    like DougDoug or UwosLab. But again, I will go more into detail once I actually plan out what I want to do. 
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    And just like with projects, and sharing the theory I learnt, I want to use this blog to talk about my hobbies that aren't related to programming or 
                    mathematics. That being said though, writing and content creation probably aren't going to be the only hobbies I talk about, as I have plans to talk about more stuff. 
                    As I am unsure if I'll ever go over them, but I wanna talk about psychology, cooking, and language learning. I do not want to be specific as again, this is a gray territory
                    and I'm unsure if I'll ever get the chance to talk about them.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    I want to use this blog site to also talk about reading, along with other media. I am a person who prefers to read a book than to watch a show, but in recent 
                    times I haven't read as much as I want to. So, I want to use this opportunity to read and review every single book I currently own. This'll be a slow process, but 
                    I honestly don't mind it, I'd rather use my free time to read than to watch YouTube. As for other media (shows, games, movies, etc.), I am quite unsure as to what 
                    I can review, as I do not indulge in shows, nor movies, and I play games occassionally. But, if I ever do feel like I have to review something I just played or 
                    watched, I will for sure do it here.  
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    To end things off, I'll occassionally have personal stuff, like rants, trips, maybe progress updates on life, and other misc. stuff. I don't want this 
                    blog to be specifically about one thing, but an amalgamation of things I enjoy. This is why I am trying to be specific, but shallow at the same time, besides 
                    the stuff I'm confident about being here, I am unsure if I'll add more things. But, before I go, I also have to say this, every blog post will have it's own 
                    unique tag. This one has <span class="personal">personal</span>. That way you know immediately what the blog post will be about. So if I do choose to 
                    talk about more things than I mentioned here, I'll just make a new tag for it. In the future I'll probably add a feature where you can search by tags, so 
                    the blog site doesn't get cluttered. As for the frequency of these posts, I will try to write them once per week, but the keyword here is try. I don't want to 
                    set myself schedules, especially tight schedules, and feel extremely bad about myself when I don't follow them. So I'll write here once I have material to write.  
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    That being said, thought, thank you for reading until the end, and I hope as this blog site grows, that the amount of readers will grow, too :) See ya in the next post!
                </p>
