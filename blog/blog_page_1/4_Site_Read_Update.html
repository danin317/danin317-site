				<h2>You can see how long a blog post will take to read now</h2>
                <h3>5th of January, 2025 ★ <span class="site-update">site update</span> ★ ~30 second read</h3>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    Bit of a lenghty blog title, but this won't take a while to say.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    Since I have severely procrastinated today (when it comes to personal projects, that is), to not feel bad I decided to create a 
                    little script that calculates the estimated reading time of a text. (and of course, outputs it to Markdown because I want to feel 
                    fancy)
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    If you're interested, <a href="https://github.com/danin317/read-o-meter" target="_blank">the source code can be found here</a>, but the code is not even 20 lines in 
                    length, it really is that simple. 
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    So yeah, from now on you can see how long the blog post will be before reading it. 
                </p>
