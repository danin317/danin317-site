                    Greetings! My name's Danin, and welcome to my webpage. Online I go by either danin317, or just danin. I am a programmer from Bosnia 
                    who's interested in web development and game development. I started coding in high school, and graduated with a degree in I.T, but I 
                    started seriously coding during university. I use Python, JavaScript, and C for the majority of my projects. 
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    Apart from programming, I also write and make video content. I enjoy writing both fiction and non-fiction. I'm also documenting 
                    my life journey on my blog, which you can read <a href="/blog/blog.html">here</a>. For fiction, I mostly write short horror stories. 
                    As for content, I make videos 100%'ing video games, along with video game challenges, and there are plans to make a programming oriented 
                    channel.
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    I'm also a life-long learner. I love learning about stuff that interests me and apply them in ways that help me, and others around me. Examples 
                    include programming, mathematics, psychology, philosophy, and productivity. I also love reading, and I read both fiction and non-fiction. I also 
                    enjoy cooking, too.
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    I absolutely adore the retro aesthetic, and I try to blend a mix of retro and modern design into my projects, along with video games. My favourite 
                    consoles are the Nintendo 64 and the Playstation 1, and a lot of my favourite games come from those consoles (if you know Buck Bumble and Sheep, Dog 'n'
                    Wolf, you're a legend). I also love watching motorsports, and I am a massive Formula 1 and rally fan (next year is our year), and I'm generally a fan of racing.
                    Also, I love listening to and talking about music, it's probably my most enjoyed hobby. I listen to a variety of genres, and if you're interested you can 
                    check out my <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/Mashtempo" target="_blank">Last.fm profile.</a>

                <p>
                    To end things off, I made this site not only to showcase my skills as a programmer and writer, but to also document my learning journey. I want to have 
                    a big accent on my personal blog, as I intend to write about personal rants, programming, mathematics, stuff I've read, learnt, et cetera. If you're reading this, 
                    I hope you're interested in watching me grow as much as I am :)
